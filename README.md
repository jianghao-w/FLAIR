# FLAIR

FLAIR is a novel approach for efficient analysis of Android ICC (inter-component communication) that addresses incremental system changes and potential vulnerabilities resulting from these changes.

## Approach
The diagram illustrates three Android ICC analysis approaches: (a) pure program analysis on the entire system; (b) a non-incremental hybrid approach combining program analysis with lightweight formal analysis; and (c) FLAIR's incremental analysis, which combines program analysis with lightweight formal analysis, recalculating ICC analysis results only for necessary incremental system changes.
